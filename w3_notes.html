			<h3>What I Learned This Module</h3>
			<p>I like how the article <cite><a href="https://javascript.info/object-methods">Object methods, "this"</a></cite> compared <span class="keyword">functions</span> to things the users (objects) do. Functions that are properties of an object are <span class="keyword">methods</span>.</p>
			<p>Now <span class="keyword">this</span> looks interesting! I'm excited to try it out to see just how useful it can be. <span class="keyword">this</span> is unbound, so not limited to the object referencing it, but is instead evaluated at the time of call.</p>
			<p>I'll be totally honest- at this point, I dont' understand the bit about <span class="keyword">arrow functions</span> having no <span class="keyword">this</span>. In my research, I found a video by <a href="https://youtu.be/mrYMzpbFz18">The Coding Train</a> about the <span class="keyword">arrow function</span>. It's a great video- I recommend! He talks about <span class="keyword">arrow functions</span> as well as how <span class="keyword">this</span> interacts in <span class="keyword">functions</span> vs <span class="keyword">arrow functions</span>. One thing he didn't really explain as clearly is that <span class="keyword">this</span> refers to the window object in simple functions, which is why his example worked well with the <span class="keyword">arrow function</span>, as it brought the reference back to the containing object. This is better explained in the <cite src="https://zellwk.com/blog/this/"><a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/this/">This in JavaScript</a></cite>.</p>
			<p><cite src="https://zellwk.com/blog/this/"><a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/this/">This in JavaScript</a></cite> was less clear about <span class="keyword">bind</span>. To find some more information on it, I went to <cite src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind">Mozilla</a></cite>. Just in the example that it provided, it better illustrated why you might want to <span class="keyword">bind</span> <span class="keyword">this</span> to a particular thing. For instance, <span class="keyword">this</span> in simple functions refers to the window object, but you can bind it to something else so that it will reference the thing you want.</p>
			<p><span class="keyword">Object Literals</span> are objects created by wrapping all of its properties and methods in braces that are mutable while the program is running, even if the object itself is a <span class="keyword">const</span>.</p>
			<p>I got really thrown off by a typo in the book. In chapter 5 while talking about <span class="keyword">computed properties</span>, it started talking about the new <span class="keyword">Symbol</span> date type, then used an example that didn't have a date. I read it 3 times without making sense of it before I looked it up elsewhere and realized it's talking about a data type, not a date type. Then there was the description of <span class="keyword">Symbols</span> themseves was confusing because they used the same word "name" for the identifier, the description, and the property name. 
			<br><br>const name = Symbol('name');
			<br>const supergirl = { [name]: 'Supergirl' };
			<br><br>It was unclear whether the property name was referencing the identifier or the description based on the example they gave. While this was confusing, it helped me see that even though I read about <span class="keyword">Symbols</span> in chapter 2, I clearly didn't understand them well enough. I found a question on the motivation for bringing <span class="keyword">Symbols</span> into ES6 on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21724326/what-is-the-motivation-for-bringing-symbols-to-es6">stackoverflow.com</a>, which outlines the original purpose was to have private properties, but they were downgraded and are not private now. This didn't really help me much, so I kept searching. I found an article about <a href="https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/metaprogramming-in-es6-symbols/">Symbols in ES6 and why they're awesome</a>. It talked about how <span class="keyword">Symbols</span> are really just a different way to attach proprties to an object. They ensure a unique value. This still didn't click to me why you would need that- can't you just use unique strings? So I kept looking. I found another article titled <cite><a href="https://medium.com/intrinsic/javascript-symbols-but-why-6b02768f4a5c">JavaScript Symbols: But Why?</a></cite>. While reading through this one, which admittedly was saying the same thing again, I had an epiphany. My mind went to family history, and how I have 2 relatives names Charles Miles Estey (grandfather and grandson). FINALLY- This is why you might want a <span class="keyword">symbol</span>! You cannot always control the names of things, and sometimes they might have the same string of characters, but are still unique, like my ancestors. This article talked about preventing name collisions when two libraries want to add properties and both happen to use the same key (which is apparently more common than I think it would be), <span class="keyword">symbols</span> would be used to make each one unique.</p>

				<p>A vacation is when you take a trip to some <span class="keyword" id="output1"></span> place with your <span class="keyword" id="output2"></span> family. Usually you go to some place that is near a/an <span class="keyword" id="output3"></span> or up on a/an <span class="keyword" id="output4"></span>. A good vacation place is one where you can ride <span class="keyword" id="output5"></span> or play <span class="keyword" id="output6"></span> or go hunting for <span class="keyword" id="output7"></span>. I like to spend my time <span class="keyword" id="output8"></span> or <span class="keyword" id="output9"></span>. When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three <span class="keyword" id="output10"></span> a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers sit around <span class="keyword" id="output11"></span>. Last summer, my little brother fell in a/an <span class="keyword" id="output12"></span> and got poison <span class="keyword" id="output13"></span> all
				over his <span class="keyword" id="output14"></span>. My family is going to go to (the) <span class="keyword" id="output15"></span>, and I will practice <span class="keyword" id="output16"></span>. Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very	<span class="keyword" id="output17"></span> and because they have to work <span class="keyword" id="output18"></span> hours every day all year making enough <span class="keyword" id="output19"></span> to pay for the vacation.</p>
				<button onclick="reset()">Reset Madlibs</button>

			<p>The purpose of the Madlibs exercise was to better understand <span class="keyword">object literals</span> and how to iterate through and change their properties. It worked much like an <span class="keyword">array</span>, though that's partly because I gave the property names numbers that could correspond with i for the loop. After completing it, I told my husband what I did, and he said this is not really a good use of an object literal because I'm just replacing all of the properties. I guess I don't really understand why I would use this. We had an extensive conversation about how the things I'm learning are preparing me for larger things later, but for now I just need to learn how to do these small things. The problem I'm having is that I don't understand why I would ever use certain things, so it's very difficult to try to apply my learning when I dont' know what I would apply it to.</p>
			<p>Some small exercises to play with <span class="keyword">RegExp</span>.</p>
			<h4>Create a Password</h4>
			<p>Password must begin with a capital letter and end in a number.</p>
			<input id="regexp-test">
			<button onclick="regExpTest()">Test Password</button>
			<div id="password-output" class="keyword"></div>
			
			<label>What word shall we count in this paragraph?</label><input id="count-input">
			<button onclick="wordCount()">Count them!</button>
			<div id="count-output" class="keyword"></div>
			<blockquote id="count-paragraph">&#9753; Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, pattern From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents' strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</blockquote>
			<p>It's rather particular, but I tweeked it just right to find and count the words (not just the patterns within any word) based on the pattern given by the user, disregarding case sensitivity.</p>
			<p>I'm familiar with the DOM and various selector properties, but was interested to learn that when you pull node lists, they are array-like, but not arrays. More interesting was how easy it is to make it an array with <span class="keyword">Array.from()</span>. However, even without converting it to an array, you can still do quite a few array-like things with the node list, like access each through index notation, get the length, or use the spread operator.</p>
			<p>I was happy to be reminded of <span class="keyword">querySelector()</span>, which I haven't used in quite some time. I like CSS, so using CSS notation is always good for me. Mental note- remember that it will only access the first element that matches the selector. This is useful for id's, as they are unique, so you'll always access what you're looking for. To find them all, use <span class="keyword">querySelectorAll()</span>. You can use CSS pseudo-selectors with this, too.</p>
			<p>I don't remember ever learning that many of the selector properties will return whitespace as text nodes. I found an interesting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Whitespace">article</a> where the author wrote some functions to test a node to see if it's ignorable to help get around the whitespace, but I think it would be more beneficial to understand how the whitespace is handled and recognized by the DOM and simply take my actions from there.</p>
			<p>Another thing I appreciated being reminded of is that you need to use camel case when altering the CSS properties through JavaScript.</p>
			<p>An important thing that I want to note is the importance of not calling things in a function that haven't loaded on the page yet. For the Quiz Ninja project, I had to move the script tag to the bottom of the page because it was starting the quiz when it loaded. With the script tag in the head of the page, it was trying to alter the innerHTML of elements before the elements had even loaded, causing an error.</p>
			<p>Important info about <span class="keyword">event listeners</span>: don't use the parentheses when the function is used as an argument to an event listener; can be used on a node or globally; <span class="keyword">pageX</span> and <span class="keyword">pageY</span> seem infinitely more useful than <span class="keyword">screenX</span>, <span class="keyword">screenY</span>, <span class="keyword">clientX</span>, and <span class="keyword">clientY</span> in locating coordinates as it relies on placement within the document itself, even accounting for scrolling; and refer often to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">list of event listeners</a> as there are more than you'd expect! </p>
			<p>I need to consider when it would be more beneficial for events to <span class="keyword">capture</span> instead of their native <span class="keyword">bubble</span>, and when it might be useful to stop the even propagation all together. </p>
