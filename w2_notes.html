			<h3>What I Learned This Module</h3>
			<p>I reviewed a lot of things I already knew, like reserved words (and some words that are not reserved, but ought to be), arrays, variables, loops, logic, operators, etc. I'll try to stick to new things.</p>
			<p>I have always used <span class="keyword">var</span>. The first new thing, and probably the new thing I'll use most, I learned about is declaring variables using <span class="keyword">let</span> and <span class="keyword">const</span>. It seemed very important in the readings that <span class="keyword">let</span> and <span class="keyword">const</span> are block scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the block they are in.I'm not sure I understand the difference between them and <span class="keyword">var</span> yet. My understanding is that <span class="keyword">var</span> is only accessible in the block it's in, too... so... ? I had to look into that further.</p>
			<p>A good answer I found was on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/whats-the-difference-between-using-let-and-var" target="_blank"> stackoverflow.com</a>, explaining that <span class="keyword">var</span> is not block scoped, but function scoped. Variables declared with <span class="keyword">var</span> are accessible in the function even before they're declared, though it will be "undefined", whereas <span class="keyword">let</span> would trigger a reference error if you try to access it before it's declared.</p>
			<p>Another great new thing I learned about was <span class="keyword">Template Literals</span>, which allow you to `Put functionality within a ${myString} and continuing the text` instead of "Adding text and then using a variable" + likeThis + "with the concatenate operator." Super exciting!</p>
			<p>I had tried to work with the <span class="keyword">join()</span> method when I was doing my extra button on the Story Editor. I was trying to get rid of the commas in the array of story titles, so was using <span class="keyword">join(' ')</span> instead. It didn't work, but this was before I realized that pulling my array out of localStorage actually turned it into a string, so of course I couldn't use it to turn it into a string with spaces instead of commas.</p>
			<p>I was very excited to learn about <span class="keyword">Sets</span>! Last week, I went thought quite an ordeal figuring out my extra button, and part of that was eliminating duplicates. Had I known about <span class="keyword">Set</span>, that particular obstacle would have been solved much more quickly.</p>
			<p>The <span class="keyword">ternary operator</span> was quite fun to learn about. I'm all about shorthand and concise coding! I'll need to practice this one to nail the syntax down.</p>
			<div>
				<label for="first-number">Give me a number</label>
				<input type="number" id="first-num" value="0">
				<br>

				<label for="second-number">Give me another number</label>
				<input type="number" id="second-num" value="0">
				<br>

				<button onclick="myTest()">Which is bigger?</button>
				<span id="answer" class="keyword"></span>
			</div>
			
			<p>This is a pretty simple example, but I think I just spent a good 30 minutes on it trying to use a few new things at once... not to mention I forgot to add <span class="keyword">.value</span> to my <span class="keyword">parseFloat</span> for long enough to be embarrassing. However, I got the <span class="keyword">ternary operator</span> to work as well as the <span class="keyword">template literals</span>... And I <em>think</em> I successfully and appropriately used a <span class="keyword">closure</span>. I went through three different successful versions of code, each time adding another thing I wanted to practice. </p>
			<p>Something that had me researching quite a bit was <span class="keyword">closures</span>. The book was just not very clear to me. I first found an article titled <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/demystifying-javascript-closures-callbacks-iifes/" target="_blank">Demystifying JavaScript Closures, Callbacks, and IIFEs</a> that was very clear. 
			
				<blockquote cite="https://www.sitepoint.com/demystifying-javascript-closures-callbacks-iifes/">In JavaScript, a closure is any function that keeps reference to variables from its parent’s scope even after the parent has returned. This means practically any function can be considered a closure, because... a function can refer to, or have access to –
					<ul>
						<li>any variables and parameters in its own function scope</li>
						<li>any variables and parameters of outer (parent) functions</li>
						<li>any variables from the global scope.</li>
					</ul>
				So, chances are you’ve already used closures without even knowing it. 
				</blockquote>
			
			Essentially, the <span class="keyword">closure</span> is a block within a block. You can refer to variables outside the closer. It stores a refence to its outer variable rather than a value.</p>
			<p>	While reading this article, they used examples of code that used a colon in a way I haven't seen before, so I had to go look that up, too. A quick example at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/418799/what-does-colon-do-in-javascript" target="_blank">stackoverflow.com</a> showed that you can use it within a <span class="keyword">closure</span> to more concisely declare values in an object. I used that in my test above, too. </p>
			<p><span class="keyword">Arrow functions</span> 
				are completely new to me. Declaring functions within a variable at all is new to me, but this is certainly concise. Parameters, then &#61;&#62;, then the main body of the anonymous function. It doesn't need to be placed in a block if it's only one line, and single parameters don't need to be inside parentheses. </p>
			<p>Some new things that interested me that I'll only mention are <span class="keyword">spread</span>, <span class="keyword">sort</span> (I might go back and add it to my story editor to sort the titles), <span class="keyword">maps</span>, <span class="keyword">for-of</span>, <span class="keyword">call-backs</span>, <span class="keyword">reduce()</span>, <span class="keyword">filter()</span>.</p>
			<p>I have a hard time coming up with questions here, because as soon as I have them, I go research them... Doesn't everyone? I hope it's clear that everything I practiced here and researched are the things that I wondered, "Just how does that work?" or "What on earth does that mean?" If you need me to be more specific in the future, please just let me know. Thanks!</p>
