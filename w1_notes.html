			<h3>What I Learned This Module</h3>
			<p>I spent a lot of my time this week setting up my portforlio. While I appreciated the example portfolio, the designer in me would not allow me to turn in something I don't think is beautiful. </p>
			<p>To that end, I obviously spent some time in CSS setting up the look and feel of the portfolio, creating a color scheme, layout, transitions, etc.</p>
			<p>My biggest question this week was, "How can I make a button that will pull the list of titles from localStorage and display them for the user so they don't have to remember the title of their story?"</p>
			<p>I spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to get the List Saved Titles button working properly. I worked, researched, and tested for more hours getting the List Saved Titles button to work than I did on the rest of the week's work put together. I went through countless variations of ways to try to make this function work and I am so proud! It was a silly thing, but I wanted the list of titles to be one per line, with no comma, no duplicates, and to remember what had been saved in previous sessions. I kept finding things that would work and satisfy some of my requirements, but not all, so had to keep going. Now that it's done, it looks so simple! It was a few hours before I realized that when I committed an array to the local storage, it was no longer an array when it came out again. I had to convert it back into an array, remove the commas, add the line break, etc. This was a great addition to my project!</p>
			<p>I spent a less embarrassing amount of time trying to create an index.php that included modules for the head, header, and navigation. I could not get it to work on Github Pages, and did a lot of researching trying to discover the error in my code before I discovered that Github Pages does not support PHP. It would have made things a lot easier, but I'm still determined to make my portfolio easily navigable.</p>
			<p>I also spent time in Doing Stuff With Web Things reviewing my coding knowledge. I was happy to learn about localStorage! In my previous classes, I had wondered how to get it to remember things that the user had already entered, besides autofill, but never discoverd this little gem. Thank you for starting the class with something I loved to learn about!</p>
			<p>Master Mobile UX was a good review of the Mobile First mindset. I was interested in the review of the affect of button placement and to learn that a staggering amount of people don't know what the hamburger button is. </p>
