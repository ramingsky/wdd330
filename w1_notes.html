			<h3>What I Learned This Module</h3>
			<p>I spent a lot of my time this week setting up my portforlio and serching the net for enhancement of my portfolio. I appreciated the example portfolio from teacher James. </p>
			<p>I look for ways to appreciate the work of others and add some of mine too. </p>
			<p>As an IT Professional i have been dealing with disk drives and local storgae and My biggest question this week would be, "How can I automate the link or have a function button that will pull the list of titles from localStorage and display them for the user so they don't have to remember the title of their files and story?"</p>
			<p>I also spent time in Doing Stuff With Web Things reviewing my coding knowledge. I was happy to learn about more about localStorage!, cloud storage, google drive and so forth, I had wondered how to get it to remember things that the user had already entered, besides autofill, but never discoverd this little gem. Thank you for starting the class with something I loved to learn about!</p>
			<p>Master Mobile UX was a good review of the Mobile First mindset, surveys and forecasts that most of the people use thier gadgets, mobile phones and tabs. The bigger screen that can be available in the laptop and desktop are dwindlind and people like the comfort and style of mobile devices. Small to them is the new norm, but i believe that sometime history repeats itself and people will again love the bigger screen in thier home and smaller screen only during mobile activities. </p>
