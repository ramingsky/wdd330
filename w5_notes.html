			<p>I like it that the book has a chapter 10 that talks about testing and debugging. You really need to know how to test and debug and its tools when you are into programming.</p>
			<p><dfn>Errors</dfn> are common and caused when something goes wrong in a program. It can be System Error, Programmer error and User error. <dfn>Exceptions</dfn> are a type of error that produces a return value and will give you information to help you deal with the error. <dfn>Stack Traces</dfn> are also produced by exceptions. They walk through the points that led to the exception. This helps you work backwards through the breadcrumbs that lead to the originating point of the error.</p>
			<p><dfn>Warnings</dfn> can be triggered if there's a small error, but the program keeps running (possibly incorrectly) despite the error. Different browsers throw out warnings differently, so you may or may not get one.</p>
			<p>You can use <dfn>strict mode</dfn> to find more errors and warnings that may not be caught otherwise, helping you debug issues before they become big. It also catches deprecated and sloppy code. This page has been written using strict mode to practice. This is excellent to me, as I am also learning Java, which is strictly typed. My lazy Javascript habits have spilled into my Java coding, which throws errors at the tiniest thing, like a missing semicolon, which sloppy mode of Javascript accepts without hesitation. You can use strict mode globally (for all of the script), or locally within a single function. Modules use strict mode by default.</p>
			<p><dfn>linting tools</dfn> can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code. Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide.</p>
			<p>Handy also is <dfn>feature detection</dfn> to run particular code based on whether it is supported in the browser running the code, keeping that unsupported feature from crashing your program.</p>
			<p>I much prefer breakpoints to alerts. Perhaps walking through each step of the code and watching the result of each command is a more effective method of debugging.</p>
			<p><dfn>console.trace()</dfn> and the <dfn>debugger</dfn> command are  advance tools that can be handy and usually used most of the programmers.</p>
			<p>Why is it important to create an <dfn>error object</dfn>? AKA <dfn>throw</dfn> an error. For reference, here are the standardly supported possibilities.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><dfn>RangeError</dfn></li>
				<li><dfn>ReferenceError</dfn>: thrown when a reference to a non-existant item is made</li>
				<li><dfn>SyntaxError</dfn></li>
				<li><dfn>TypeError</dfn></li>
				<li><dfn>URIError</dfn>: thrown when there's an issu encoding or decoding the URI... What's that?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For me <dfn>try</dfn>, <dfn>catch</dfn>, and <dfn>finally</dfn> deserves a usage as a programmer and user.</p>

			<p>I kind of need more time to wrap my head around on how the use of Jest. I found it very useful though, i think i will try the examples that is in the book to fully understand. Thank you!</p>
