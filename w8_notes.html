            <h4>Chapter 8: CSS3 Transforms & Transitions</h4>
            <h5>Transforms</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Transform property: <ul>
                        <li>lets you translate, rotate, scale or skew any elements on the page</li>
                        <li>CSS3 gives you unprecedented control over many more aspects of the element’s appearance.
                        </li>
                        <li>can be stacked, but shouldn't be repeated (second will replace first) ex: transform:
                            translateX(10px) scale(.5);</li>
                        <li>doesn't work on inline elements, but that's easy to fix, just add display: inline-block; to
                            our span.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Translation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow you move elements left, right, up, down, similar to position: relative -- using x and
                            y axes.</li>
                        <li>Moving elements does not impact the flow of the document</li>
                        <li>moves elements relative to their current position</li>
                        <li>The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top:</li>
                        <li>alternate option: transform: translateX(10px) or translateY(10px)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Scaling:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then
                            vertically.</li>
                        <li>transform: scale(x,y) -- if only x or y is provided, it will apply to both height and width.
                            ex: scale(2) would double the size proportionally.</li>
                        <li>can also use scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) alone</li>
                        <li>does not impact document flow; embiggened stuff will overlap things around it.</li>
                        <li>scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center; in other words,
                            the element’s center will stay in the same place as its dimensions change. To change this
                            default behavior, you can include the transform-origin property.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Rotation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle
                            value.</li>
                        <li>rotates items around the center point unless specified with transform-origin</li>
                        <li>positive degrees move clockwise, negative move counterclockwise</li>
                        <li>transform: rotate(10deg)</li>
                        <li>In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns, but we’ll just
                            be sticking with degrees.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Skew:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the skey(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes by degrees</li>
                        <li>transform: skew(Xdeg, Ydeg);</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Changing the Origin of the Transform:
                    <ul>
                        <li>transform-origin property defaults to center; change for more dramatic results</li>
                        <li>order matters! Transforms are applied in the order given; if you rotate first, the item will
                            move on the rotated axis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Transitions</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but native CSS
                            transitions generally require less client-side processing, so they’ll usually appear
                            smoother. On mobile devices with limited computing power, this can be a lifesaver.</li>
                        <li>
                            Transitions apply when a class is changed; saves JavaScript some work.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Declare the original state of the element</li>
                                <li>Declare the altered state, ex. :hover</li>
                                <li>Include transition functions in the default/originating style with transition
                                    properties</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>transition-property: specifies which property of an element should show the transition
                            happening; defaults to all</li>
                        <li>transition-duration: specifies how long animation should take, in s or ms. (200ms is optimum
                            for basic transitions like hover effects)</li>
                        <li>transition-timing-function: controls the pace of the transition, ex: ease, linear, ease-in,
                            ease-out, ease-in-out. Can also customize with cubic-bezier function. This is complex and
                            beyond my desire to learn.</li>
                        <li>steps function -- a transition-timing function
                            <ul>
                                <li>define the number of steps and the direction of either start or end (where the first
                                    step happens)</li>
                                <li>steps(5, start) jumps through the animation equally over 5 steps starting with 0%
                                    and ending at 80%, whereas steps(5, end) would start with 20% and end with 100%.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>transition-delay: how long to wait before starting the animation, in s or ms.</li>
                        <li>transition shorthand: declare property, duration, timing-function, delay, on one line.</li>
                        <li>Transitioning more than one thing at the same time in different ways: declare with commas
                            and specify in order. Ex:
                            <ul>
                                <li>transition-property: transform, color (specifies two properties)</li>
                                <li>transition-duration: .2s, .1s (color will change faster than transform)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Animations</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via
                            keyframes.</li>
                        <li>Allows you to define keyframes -- snapshots with the starting or ending point of the
                            transition</li>
                        <li>Good alternative to JavaScript animation; better to use for simple-state changes especially
                            on mobile</li>
                        <li>Keyframes:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Defined with @keyframes, then a name of your choosing (like a function declaration)
                                </li>
                                <li>@keyframes myAnimation { keyframes here }</li>
                                <li>keyterms: from and to (0% and 100%)</li>
                                <li>Each keyframe includes properties to be animated.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>animation-name: myAnimation; within an element's styles declares the animation (calls the
                            keyframes function) </li>
                        <li>animation-duration property defines the length of time (in seconds or milli-seconds) an
                            animation takes to complete one iteration (all the way through, from 0% to 100%):</li>
                        <li>animation-timing-function with same parameters as transition-timing-function above.</li>
                        <li>animation-direction: usually goes from 0-100% (normal), but can be specified to go backward
                            with reverse or alternate forwards/backwards with alternate or alternate-reverse.</li>
                        <li>animation-delay: specifies how long to wait before starting the animation.</li>
                        <li>animation-fill-mode: specifies what happens before and after the animation (none by
                            default).
                            <ul>
                                <li>forwards -- holds the last keyframe after animation ends</li>
                                <li>backwards -- loads the element with the first animated state and reverts to default
                                    after the animation ends</li>
                                <li>both -- will start out with the first animated state and hold onto the last animated
                                    state after it ends</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>animation-play-state: accepts running or paused; can be controlled with CSS or JS.</li>
                        <li>animation shorthand: name, duration, timing function, delay, iteration-count, direction,
                            fill-mode, and play-state, declared in any order on one line.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h4>
                    <h4>Canvas</h4>

            </ul>
            <h4>SVG</h4>
            <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector
                graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images
                (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or
                shrink them down. We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas, including drawing
                paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns.</p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
            <p>The Drag and Drop API. This API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then
                specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements
                on the page.</p>
